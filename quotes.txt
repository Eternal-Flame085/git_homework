The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again
and expecting a different result.
                                  - Albert Einstein.

"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is living with the results of other people's thinking."
                                  -Steve Jobs
